In your README, please note down:
- A brief description talking about your rationale behind the hyperparameters during training

- When training your own transformer, what is the difference between the preprocess you did on the previous assignment
and the preprocess you are doing right now?

- Give one positive and negative side about using the GPT-2 tokenizer for your own transformer

- Compare the perplexities of both models. Which one is better? Why? Explain briefly.

- Is this a fair comparison? Why?

- What could be the advantages of using a pre-trained model? What is a possible use case?
